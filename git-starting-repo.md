# Initializing / Cloning a repository

For start a new repository using git you need to start him in a folder or clone from a remote repository.


# Starting a git repository

For **starting** a new git repository, inside the directory that you wanna make your project, open the terminal / git bash and type: 

```bash
    git init
```
Using this command the git application will create a ``.git`` folder in your directory. Making it ready to make local adds and commits.

# Cloning a repository

For **cloning** a repository inside the directory or passing it's path, type:

```bash
    git clone <url>
    git clone <url> <destination>
```

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something different from the origin you can pass an additional argument

```bash
    git clone <url> <name-of-the-directory>
```
